Use this solution to use AWS EKS cluster as a hub. This solution uses AWS IAM roles for authentication,
hence only Managed Clusters running on EKS will be able to use this solution.

Refer [this](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/ocm/tree/main/solutions/joining-hub-and-spoke-with-aws-auth)
article for detailed registration instructions.
